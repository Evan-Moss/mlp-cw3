# MLP CW3

Coursework 3 for Edinburgh university 4th year course Machine Learning Practical.

Our project is an exploration of different reinforcement learning techniques applied to the video game snake.

The initial code is taken from a simple Deep Q learning implementation in snake from [this repository.](https://github.com/python-engineer/snake-ai-pytorch/)
